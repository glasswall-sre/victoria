.. py:class:: EncryptionProvider

   Bases: :class:`abc.ABC`

   Abstract base class for an encryption provider. Provides methods
   for envelope encrypting/decrypting arbitrary byte/string sequences.

   .. method:: encrypt(self, data: bytes)
      :abstractmethod:


      Encrypt bytes to an EncryptionEnvelope.

      :param data: The data to encrypt.
      :type data: bytes

      :returns: The encrypted data.
      :rtype: EncryptionEnvelope


   .. method:: encrypt_str(self, data: str, encoding: Optional[str] = 'utf-8')


      Encrypt a string to an EncryptionEnvelope.

      :param data: The string to encrypt.
      :type data: str
      :param encoding: The encoding of the data. Default utf-8.
      :type encoding: str, optional

      :returns: The encrypted data.
      :rtype: EncryptionEnvelope


   .. method:: decrypt(self, envelope: EncryptionEnvelope)
      :abstractmethod:


      Decrypt an EncryptionEnvelope to bytes.

      Please note that this can return None if the key encryption key
      is out of date.

      :param envelope: The envelope to decrypt.
      :type envelope: EncryptionEnvelope

      :returns: The decrypted data.
                None: If the key encryption key was out of date.
      :rtype: bytes


   .. method:: decrypt_str(self, envelope: EncryptionEnvelope, encoding: Optional[str] = 'utf-8')


      Decrypt an EncryptionEnvelope to a string.

      Please note that this can return None if the key encryption key
      is out of date.

      :param envelope: The envelope to decrypt.
      :type envelope: EncryptionEnvelope
      :param encoding: The encoding of the data. Default utf-8.
      :type encoding: str, optional

      :returns: The decrypted data.
                None: If the key encryption key was out of date.
      :rtype: str


   .. method:: rotate_key(self, envelope: EncryptionEnvelope, version: Optional[str] = None)
      :abstractmethod:


      Rotate an EncryptionEnvelope encrypted with an old version of the
      key encryption key to a different version.

      Basically just decrypts it with the old key and reencrypts it with the
      new key.

      :param envelope: The envelope to rotate.
      :type envelope: EncryptionEnvelope
      :param version: The specific KEK version to use. Defaults
                      to the latest if not given. You probably don't want to specify
                      this, as the latest will be the best version.
      :type version: str, optional

      :returns: The newly rotated encrypted data.
      :rtype: EncryptionEnvelope


   .. method:: _data_encrypt(self, data: bytes)


      Asymmetrically encrypt a piece of data, returning a tuple containing
      the encrypted data as a bytes object, the plaintext (!) encryption key
      as a bytes object, and the nonce used to encrypt as a bytes object.

      Uses a 256-bit AES cipher in Galois Counter Mode, as recommended by
      Google for generating data encryption keys:
      https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption#data_encryption_keys

      Uses a 96-bit nonce length, as recommended by NIST for AES in GCM:
      https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38d/final

      :param data: The data to encrypt.

      :returns:     bytes: Encrypted data
                    bytes: Plaintext (!) data encryption key -- encrypt with your
                        key encryption key ASAP and do NOT store in plaintext!!
                    bytes: 96-bit nonce value used with data encryption key when
                        encrypting data. Under NO circumstances to be reused for
                        encryption with the same key.
      :rtype: Tuple


   .. method:: _data_decrypt(self, data: bytes, key: bytes, nonce: bytes)


      Decrypt a piece of data with its plaintext data encryption key, and
      its nonce.

      For more information on encryption, please see the '_data_encrypt()'
      function.

      :param data: The data to decrypt.
      :param key: The plaintext (!) data encryption key.
      :param nonce: The nonce used to encrypt the data with the key.

      :returns: The decrypted data.
      :rtype: bytes
